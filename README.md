# WalmartMSWord
A project aiming to create a document viewer complete with the latest and greatest visualization features. (Work in Progress)

Prompt: In this project, you and your team (if applicable) will develop an interactive document visualization tool to explore a provided dataset

Visualization Components: Your interactive visualization should consist of the following components:
1.	Document ID List: This section will display a list of document IDs.
2.	Document Workspace: A workspace that allows users to view the text content of documents, utilizing a visual metaphor similar to opening a text file in MS Word.
   
Interactive Features: Your visualization should incorporate the following interactive features:
1.	Ordering Document IDs: Implement direct manipulation for ordering the list of document IDs. Avoid using menus or buttons for this purpose.
2.	Selection: Enabling users to select an item from the document ID list will display the corresponding document's text in the workspace.
3.	Multiple Selection: Allow users to select multiple document IDs from the list, which will open multiple documents simultaneously in the workspace.
4.	Drag and Move: Implement drag-and-drop functionality within the workspace, enabling users to move opened documents.
